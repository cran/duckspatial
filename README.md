The **{duckspatial}** package provides fast and memory-efficient
functions to analyze and manipulate large spatial vector datasets in R.
It allows R users to benefit directly from the analytical power of
[DuckDB and its spatial
extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/spatial/functions),
while remaining fully compatible with R’s spatial ecosystem, especially
**{sf}**.

At its core, **{duckspatial}** bridges two worlds:

- R spatial workflows based on {sf} objects
- Database-backed spatial analytics powered by DuckDB SQL

This design makes **{duckspatial}** especially well suited for:

- Working with large spatial data sets
- Speeding up spatial analysis at scale
- Workflows where data does not fit comfortably in memory

Importantly, **{duckspatial}** brings the power of DuckDB spatial to R
users while keeping workflows similar to {sf} .

# Installation

You can install duckspatial directly from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("duckspatial")
```

Or you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Cidree/duckspatial")
```

# Core idea: flexible spatial workflows

A central design principle of {duckspatial} is that the same spatial
operation can be used in different ways, depending on how your data is
stored and how you want to manage memory and performance.

Most functions in {duckspatial} support four complementary workflows:

1.  Input`sf` → Output `sf`
2.  Input `sf` → Output DuckDB table
3.  Input DuckDB table → Output `sf`
4.  Input DuckDB table → Output DuckDB table

See the [“Get Started” vignette for
examples](https://Cidree.github.io/duckspatial/articles/duckspatial.html).
